- No critical sonar code smells
- End-to-End tests performed



### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| 0      |    10     |    -   |     82h       |     79h 5m         |

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation) : 5h 10m
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent from previous table : 1.006

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
- Technical Debt management:
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube only for the selected and planned issues 
  - Hours spent on remediation 
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability")
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability )
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
Testing includes more hours and time spent to solve github issues was less than eximated

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
<br>Connect Sonar with JS test to report sonar coverage and no more Jest coverage 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
<br>Better coordination between Back-end and front-end


> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
